# geohash_extractor
Extracting Geo hash encoded string from given latitude longitude

Got the code from http://developer-should-know.com/post/87283491372/geohash-encoding-and-decoding-algorithm .
The important thing that needed to be done is to accomodate various badly written lat-long cases whether 
in the same string or as different double.
